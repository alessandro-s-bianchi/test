# What it does ?

The `heiho.js` script is quick and simple spreadsheet viewer. It is meant to
preview the contents of **csv** files inside your browser without needing
any other tools. It uses plain vanilla javascript so it has no dependencies,
but for the applied styling from the css file.

This is not a spreadsheet editor, this is a preview tool only.

# How to use ?

Simply include both the javascript file and the css stylesheet in your HTML document.
It's best if you put them at the bottom, close to the closing `<\body>` tag.

```html
<script src="heiho/heiho.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="heiho/heiho.css" />
```
